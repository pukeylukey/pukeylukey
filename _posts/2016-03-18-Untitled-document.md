About Prezi

In our last lesson we were looking at a website called Prezi. This website allows you to create presentations but you could use many different things unlike other presentation sites. Once we had set up we could 'play about' on Prezi. We could add lines to show which order we wanted the presentation to go. Overall I found it very interesting and fun to work on.
