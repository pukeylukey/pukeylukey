What I have taken in from our IT lessons.

As you may know, our class is has learnt media in our IT lessons. I have learnt quite a bit such as learning not to put private details such as where you live or what school you go to otherwise you might not be able to get it back in time or take it off the media; this could cause many bad things such as older people possibly following you or random people at school where no one has ever seen them before. 

We also have learnt that any types of videos maybe even barbie doll ones could 'attract' you into doing things which you are not supposed to do. This leads me nicely onto my next point which is about games and messaging media such as snapchat or instagram. Mr Keen has told us not to go on to games or media which have specific content which younger children may not use. Games such as Black Ops or Call of Duty are not supposed to be aimed at children of our age but for older teenagers. If you get addicted to this sort of media it could get really out of control and you get end yourself in not a nice situation. 

Overall, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about media and how to use it safely.
