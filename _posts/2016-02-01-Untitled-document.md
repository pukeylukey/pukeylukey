What I did today 01/02/2016

Today in IT we started off by talking about our homework. Then we went on to look at a video called "I lost my phone". It showed how if you didn't have a phone then it would sort of be different and you’re sort of 'discriminating’ others who don’t have a phone. Those people aren’t having as much fun. e.g  A part of showed a woman who was having champagne with her friend and was about to go ‘cheers’ but her friend was on social media and took a selfie instead of talking with her friend. 

Then we looked at another video which showed a group of people who were singing a song about Twitter and how it can "complete" your life. They said about how Twitter saved the Arab Spring which could be true but their main point was saying how every post you put up is a good post.
