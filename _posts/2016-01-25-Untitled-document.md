What I did today.                                                                                               25.01.16

Today in IT we were looking at the advantages and disadvantages of the social media. For example for the disadvantages someone put up 'sexting' which is basically putting sexual images of yourself to other people. An advantage is talking to people and giving your share on things. We went through all of them discussing if we were right or not with our answers.
