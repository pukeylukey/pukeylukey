What we did today

Today we were looking at media literacy. For example we were talking about how snapchat was a good social media website because the posts could only stay up for a certain amount of time and how pornographic photos were illegal. Then we did a bingo game which we had ask classmates questions and the only way you could get a box ticked off was by the questioned person saying yes.

 Finally we watched an advert from 'kia’ ( the car dealer) which had three fat hamsters and they were doing workout in the gym for hours on end. But afterwards we discussed who was the target audience,what was the text, what was the subtext and what was 'hidden’ within the advert.
