REVENGE PORN ARTICLE

**Children as young as 11 are among more than 1,000 alleged victims of revenge porn who reported offences in the first year of the new law coming into effect, it has been revealed.**

In April 2015, it became an offence to share private sexual photographs or films without the subject's consent.

The BBC analysed Freedom of Information requests from 31 forces in England and Wales between April and December.

Online safety charities said victims were left "hugely damaged".

Revenge porn refers to the act of a partner or ex-partner purposefully distributing images or videos of a sexual nature without the other person's consent.

Our analysis shows:

* There were 1,160 reported incidents of revenge pornography from April 2015 to December 2015

* Three victims were 11 years old with some 30% of offences involving young people under 19

* The average age of a revenge porn victim was 25

* Around 11% of reported offences resulted in the alleged perpetrator being charged, 7% in a caution and 5% in a community resolution

* Some 61% of reported offences resulted in no action being taken against the alleged perpetrator. Among the main reasons cited by police include a lack of evidence or the victim withdrawing support

* Facebook was used by perpetrators in 68% of cases where social media was mentioned in reports. Then came Instagram (12%) followed by Snapchat (5%

SEXTING NEWS ARTICLE

Police in England and Wales are producing new guidelines designed to avoid "criminalising" children caught sending indecent images to each other.

Under current Home Office rules any such "sexting" incident reported to the police must be recorded as a crime.

The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) will advise teachers on when they should report such incidents.

It confirmed to the BBC that new guidelines were being developed but were in very early stages.

## Criminal offence

Sending indecent selfies to a friend or lover using a smartphone is known as sexting.

Typically in England and Wales, producing and distributing sexual images of anybody under 18 is a criminal offence, even if two under-18s are sexting one another.

If an incident of teen sexting is reported to police, the names of those allegedly involved can be stored on the Police National Database for at least 10 years, even if no criminal charges are brought.

In 2015, a Freedom of Information request by the Sun revealed that 1,000 under-18s had been investigated by police for sexting between 2012 and 2014.

The new guidance, which will be sent to schools and police forces in England and Wales, will advise teachers on when they should report sexting to the police.

"These incidences do not need to be reported in every situation," said Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, of the NPCC.

"Parents and professionals can use their own judgement on when to involve the police."

The [Sunday Times newspaper suggested](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1668218.ece) that the guidance might advise that incidents involving children being blackmailed or bullied over their naked pictures were the sort of more "serious cases" where teachers might decide to involve the police.
