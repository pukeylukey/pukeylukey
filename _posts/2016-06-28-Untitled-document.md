What we did/learnt in our lesson                                                                             27.06.2016

    In our lesson today we started off by going through peoples homework. We then moved on to learning about media safety especially about porn websites and sexting.we were told to put our hands up if we think that texting is a positive or negative thing for media or if sexting is a positive or negative thing for media. 

Mr Keen mainly wanted us to concentrate about sexting and revenge porn. In this lesson I learnt that sexting, porn websites and stalking were very negative things in the media. Overall that is what we did/ learnt in our IT lesson.
