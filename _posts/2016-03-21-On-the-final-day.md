On the final day we checked if our website was going as planned. Mine went perfectly well apart from me changing the font. I struggled with it but I will be able to do it with help from my friends.  Ethan also had to go through this and he did it eventually. Also we made sure there weren't any problems with our website and if there were then we had to work what we could do to solve them.
