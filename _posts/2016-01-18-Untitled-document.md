What we did today 

Today in IT we were looking at advertisements and discussing what was fantastical about them and what was the reality in them. There were some very good points made. We then played a sort of game which involved a side of disagreement and agreement. Mr Keen then asked questions on media and we had to go to the side depending on if we agreed with the statement or not.
