In our IT lesson we were looking at a video which involved the part of Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat Scene. We had a small talk about what was 'computery' about the sorting hat scene. We then were told to look at the Google Classroom post that Mr Keen put up. It sent us straight to Java Hub which told us to create the sorting hat scene within about 7 simple steps. For homework we went on to Java Hub again but this time to make the Sorting Hat Scene with coding. This is what I ended up with:

 function onStart(  ) {

    

}

function onShake(  ) {

    if (globals.randomnumber == 1) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Rayner");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    if (globals.randomnumber == 2) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Pearson");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    if (globals.randomnumber == 3) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Thorne");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    if (globals.randomnumber == 4) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Holman");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    if (globals.randomnumber == 5) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Newman");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    if (globals.randomnumber == 6) {

   	 

   	 else {

   		 

   		 microbit.say("Foxell");

   		 

   	 }

   	 

   	 

    }

    

    

}
