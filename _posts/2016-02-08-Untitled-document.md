What we did today		

	

	

		

Today in our IT lesson we started off by looking at our homework. I was a bit worried that he would read out my homework because I didn't type much. Next Mr Keen told us to get a piece of paper and on it we should create a 'My Identity' poster which literally means we create a poster about our identity such as our roots and our family. We did that until the end of the lesson.
